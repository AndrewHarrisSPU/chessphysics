	Breaking with traditional engines, Google's <a href = 'https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go'>AlphaZero</a> begins <em>tabula rasa</em>, with no insight into the game other than knowledge of the basic rules. The engine then trains itself, developing heuristics for evaluation from Monte Carlo explorations of the game tree. Over time, 'neural' networks accumulate skill.

</p><p>
	After 9 hours of such training, results against the top-ranked (but traditionally engineered) StockFish engine revealed AlphaZero had developed dominating skill. AlphaZero's developers <a hrev = 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815'>reported</a> 25 wins, 25 draws, and 0 losses with the white pieces, and 3 wins, 47 draws, and 0 losses with the black pieces.

</p><p>
	Some have argued the match-up was unfair due to the amount of pre-game computation performed in training by AlphaZero. The energy perspective can help to make sense of this training phase.
