	Meanwhile, the <a href = 'https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget'>Intel Power Gadget</a> utility logged energy consumption by the testing apparatus. It reported an 'average package power' consumption of \( 5.568480 \) \( W \). This figure combines all subsystems, reflecting the 'whole body' of the machine, much as the \(Chess\)-\(Second\) reflects the 'whole body' of a chess player.
