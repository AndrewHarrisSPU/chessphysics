	It is now possible to pose a question for empirical research. How does the energy consumption of chess-playing humans and machines compare?

</p><p>
	From <a href = 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23455094_The_stress_of_chess_players_as_a_model_to_study_the_effects_of_psychological_stimuli_on_physiological_responses_An_example_of_substrate_oxidation_and_heart_rate_variability_in_man'>research</a> on human players, a physical unit can be derived. Reportedly, players spent an average of \( 138 \) \( kCal \) in one hour games. With \( 1 \) \( kCal = 4184 \) \( J\), over \( 3600 \) \( s \), we can arrive at a figure of \( 160.4 \) \( W \). From this, we can define a \(Chess\)-\(Second\) as the unit of energy spent in 1 second of physiologically demanding chess. Observationally:

	\( 160.4 \) \( J=1 \) \(Chess\)-\(Second\)

</p><p>
	GM Hikaru Nakamura, the world's top ranked blitz chess player, will provide a useful demonstration of the \(Chess\)-\(Second\). He engages with <a href = "https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a>'s 'Puzzle Rush', solving an impressive 52 consecutive positions in 276 seconds, which we will simply take to be \( 276 \) \(Chess\)-\(Seconds\). This figure will then be related to machine performance.
