	Chess engine physics

</p></div><p>
	This semi-empirical investigation will explore the physics of chess engines, and energy consumption in particular. It begins with a theoretical prologue, continues with experimental research on human and machine energy consumption, and concludes with an interpretation of recent innovation in the field. Machines are found to surpass humans on several measures.
