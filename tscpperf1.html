	A comparison of Nakamura's performance can be made with <a href = 'http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/TSCP/'>Tom's Simple Chess Program</a> ('TSCP')

<ul><li>
	A rush routine was created to give the 52 positions from Nakamura's rush to the TSCP engine, which was then instructed to compute the first move.

</li><br><li>
	A 'think time' parameter was gradually increased until all first moves matched Nakamura's.

</li><br><li>
	Move cacheing and opening books were disabled to ensure TSCP was unable to simply look up any solutions.

</li><br><li>
	The rush routine was modified to calculate a single position 30 times, and results averaged to obtain a consistent measure of time to solve a position. Formulaically, \(t_{avg} = \sum_{p=1}^{52} \sum_{t=1}^{30} \frac{t_{p}}{30}\)

</li></ul><p>
	A mean duration of \( 14.7179 \) \( s \) was observed on the test apparatus when correctly solving the sequence of 52 positions in Nakamura's rush.
